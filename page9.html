                     <p><strong>GRADUATE EDUCATION 
</strong></p><p><strong>Masters 
</strong></p><p>A masters is the first level of graduate coursework and can be obtained after you receive a bachelor’s degree. Earning a masters usually requires two years of full-time study, which amounts to 36 to 54 semester credits. 
</p><p>Those who pursue education as a career will undergo courses that are designed to train future educators. Fortunately, there is a wide variety of courses designed for students who wish to supplement any teaching credentials. These courses are offered at various institutions across the globe. 
</p><p>China is seeking to promote the development of first-class universities. China's economy is already the world's second largest and is still growing. Experiencing its culture and understanding its market growth will boost your career.

                     <p><strong>Basic Education 
</strong></p><p>Basic education in China includes Pre-school education (usually three years), primary education (six years, usually starting at the age of six) and secondary education (six years). 
</p><p>Secondary education has two routes: academic secondary education and specialized/vocational/technical secondary education. Academic secondary education consists of junior (three years) and senior middle schools (three years). Junior middle school graduates wishing to continue their education take a locally administered entrance exam, on the basis of which they will have the option of continuing in an academic senior middle school, or entering a vocational middle school (or leave school at this point) to receive two to four years of training. Senior middle school graduates wishing to go to universities must take National Higher Education Entrance Exam (Gao Kao). According to the Chinese Ministry of Education, in June 2015, 9.42 million students took the exam. 
</p><p><strong>Higher Education 
</strong></p><p>Higher education is further divided into two categories: 1) universities that offer four-year or five-year undergraduate degrees to award academic degree qualifications; and 2) colleges that offer three-year diploma or certificate courses on both academic and vocational subjects. Postgraduate and doctoral programs are only offered at universities. 
</p><p><strong>Adult Education 
</strong></p><p>The adult education ranges from primary education to higher education. For example, adult primary education includes Workers’ Primary Schools, Peasants’ Primary Schools in an effort to raise literacy level in remote areas; adult secondary education includes specialized secondary schools for adults; and adult higher education includes traditional radio/TV universities (now online), most of which offer certificates/diplomas but a few offer regular undergraduate degrees.

</strong></p><p>A PhD, also known as a Doctor of Philosophy degree, is a doctorate awarded by a university to the academic who has met all necessary qualifications and can now be considered a doctor in his or her academic field. 
</p><p>Education is defined as the process of acquiring knowledge in any form, whether that be beliefs, habits, skills or values. There are many ways for individuals to pursue and receive education.

                     <p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">China also possesses a rapidly developing higher education system. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">This is reflected in excellent opportunities for international PhD students. 
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">China is a key member of the BRICS group of countries with fast-growing economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and is home to some of the group’s leading research universities. These offer excellent platforms for collaboration with experts and academics as well as international educational projects. The Chinese higher education system is growing rapidly, with an increase in enrolment of 170% between 1998-2010. &nbsp;</span><br></p><p>Because of this the Government are investing more money into the country’s universities through flagship schemes such as Project-958 and the Double First Class University Plan. These initiatives aim to produce world-class universities further increasing the prestige of Chinese institutions and recruiting great PhD students is a key part of that ambition. 
</p><p>Plus, you’ll have the opportunity to take part in some great extra-curricular activities, whether that means walking the Great Wall of China or participating in dragon and lion dances at the Chinese New Year festivals.

                     <p><strong>Flight and Airport Pick up services</strong> 
</p><p>KVI seek to educate you about some useful tips if you are flying for the first time. We encourage you to take the pain to read carefully as it enlightens you up before, during and after arrival . We shall address them in an unordered list of interesting topics.  
</p><p>Air travel is a form of travel in vehicles such as helicopters, hot air balloons, blimps, gliders, hang gliding, parachuting, airplanes, jets, or anything else that can sustain flight. Use of air travel has greatly increased in recent decades - worldwide it doubled between the mid-1980s and the year 2000. Air travel are in two categories. Domestic and International.
</p><p><strong>Domestic and international flights 
</strong></p><p>Air travel can be separated into two general classifications: national/domestic and international flights. Flights from one point to another within the same country are called domestic flights. Flights from a point in one country to a point within a different country are known as international flights. Travelers can use domestic or international flights in either private or public travel. 
</p><p><strong>Prepare travel Document</strong> 
</p><p>Travel document needed for each air travel route varies . Unlike international air travels,domestic air travel mostly don’t require visas.Different countries or travel destinations requires the International Air travel traveller to have specific documents. However, for contingent purposes, we advise you to always carry the following, in no particular order before and during your travel : 
</p><p>Printed copies of passport and visas 
</p><p>Printed and electronic copies of travel itinerary 
</p><p>&nbsp;Printed copy of my accommodation confirmation (if available) 
</p><p>Visa-supporting travelling documents (e.g. invitation letter) 
</p><p>For travel in many South American and African countries you will also need an international Certificate of Vaccination card proving that you have the required vaccinations (eg yellow fever). While you might be able to get the shots at the border it is much easier (and possibly safer) to get them at home before you travel</p>

</p><p>Would also recommend keeping a list of your credit and debit cards together with the phone numbers to call in case you lose them. 
</p><p>In some countries (eg Argentina) you will want to keep proof of purchase of local currency so that you will be allowed to exchange any remaining pesos back to dollars when you leave. 
</p><p>Additional means of identification -- be it driving license or national ID card -- in case something happens to your passport. At the very least, your embassy would like to see these. 
</p><p>I also store encrypted electronic copies of the most important travelling documents on a cloud storage service, e.g. Dropbox. 
</p><p><strong>Luggage 
</strong></p><p>There are useful information each traveller should know concerning their travel luggage. Travel luggage size is prescribed by the airline company under whose services you subscribe for your international travel. We advise first time travelers to declare at the airline desk&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TIPS FOR FLYING  
</strong></p><p>Here are a few tips to help take the stress out of your airport and flight experience. 
</p><p>If you are bringing a mobile phone and/or laptop with you, it’s a good idea to have these fully charged before you leave. You will be able to use these at the airport, but once you’re on the plane they will have to be switched off during take off and landing and in the case of your mobile, possibly the duration of the flight, depending on your airline’s regulations. 
</p><p>Make sure that your luggage is packed in accordance with the regulations for checked luggage and hand luggage. 
</p><p>Make sure you get to the airport early, as you may have to queue at check-in. Contact your airline to find out what time their check-in closes. Also allow plenty of time to find your way around. 
</p><p>Make sure that you keep your passport, visa(s) and air ticket in an easily accessible place, for inspection at check-in. 
</p><p>Once you have checked in, your air ticket will be exchanged for a boarding pass, which you will need to have available for inspection at security check-points and Passport Control. 
</p><p>Take note of our tips on going through Airport Security to help you get through smoothly and quickly. 
</p><p>
</p><p>Once you have gone through Airport Security, check one of the many screens around the terminal building to ensure that your flight is on time. You could also sign up for SMS or email flight status alerts. Check the boarding gate you need to go to, and at what time. Allow plenty of time to get to your boarding gate - some of them are further away than others. Boarding will be announced at least 45 minutes before departure and boarding gates will close 15 minutes before departure. 
</p><p>
</p><p>If you still have plenty of time you’ll be able to browse our Duty Free shops, have a cup of coffee and a meal and buy a book or magazine to read on the flight. 
</p><p>During the flight, try to drink plenty of water to combat dehydration. 
</p><p>Stretch your legs and try to take regular walks throughout the flight to keep the blood circulating in your legs. This will ease the discomfort of sitting for a long time.&nbsp;</p>

                                       Yes. There are bachelor, master and doctorate programs taught in English at China's universities.

If your native language is English, or your class was taught in English for the past three years, you don't have to provide English proficiency certificate.

With us, however, you have a professional team to help you and fight for you – with low cost. When applying directly to an overseas university, the process can be complicated and confusing, not to mention the time-zone difference and the language barrier. 
<br>
<br>Searching information is difficult. Nearly 1000 universities in China can recruit international students. Therefore, it will be difficult for you to search school and program information if you are applying for more universities. 
<br>
<br>The procedure is complicated. Most universities do not provide online application and it’s complicated to complete application. You need to download the application forms, transfer application fee from the bank, and deliver application documents. And student cannot effectively track application status online. 
<br>
<br>School teachers cannot provide high-quality and timely service. University admission committee is processing thousands of applications every week. So attempting to get response for your questions about entry requirements, program details and your application status could take a while. Many students complain that nobody replies their email, no one answers their calls or even most teachers cannot communicate with English. 
<br>
<br>Accommodation cannot be guaranteed. Normally, supervisor of dorms can only speak Chinese. It will be difficult for you to book accommodation if your Chinese is not good. 
<br>
<br>Admission package might get lost during delivery. Normally, the university mail students’ admission package by air mail. It’s slow and easy to get lost. If this happens, you will miss the chance for studying in China. 
<br>
<br>No late service. Most schools don’t provide documents to guide students how to get to the university from the airport, how to complete registration and how to pay their tuition and other fees.&nbsp;<br></p>
